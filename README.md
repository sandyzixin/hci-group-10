## Description

This repository is used during the project to collaborate on the Unity Games.

## Steps to run our Unity Games

### Dependencies

* Make sure the Unity version is 2021.3.34f1
* The controller version can only be played with a PS4 controller.

### Installing

* Download the "FPS game - PC" and "FPS game - Controller" folders (which are our Unity projects).

### Executing program

* Open Unity Hub.
* Add the two projects which you just installed.
* Open the project.
* Make sure you have only the "IntroMenu" scene loaded in the hierarchy.
* Run the game by clicking on play.

## Notes

* For the controller version, the win scene where you need to input a player name, should be used with keyboard and mouse.
* When the "IntroMenu" scene is not in the hierarchy, you can find the scene in Assets/FPS/Scenes/ and drag the correct scene in the hierarchy.
* When there are multiple scenes running at the same time, make sure only the "IntroMenu" scene is loaded.
* When you load in a level, but cannot move, open and close the option menu. It should then load the level corretly.
